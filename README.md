Year on year, hotels are witnessing an increased trend with cancellations. With one out of four hotel guests canceling bookings ahead of a stay, the trend has led to hotels not being able to accurately forecast occupancy within their revenue management besides facing loss in opportunity cost (unsold room due to cancellation). Some hotels think that high cancellations is the new norm in the industry. This however is a completely wrong approach.

Goal

The Goals of this project is to find out the characteristic of customers who cancelled and finding a pattern in cancelled booking by doing an exploratory data analysis and to build a classification machine learning model to predict cancellation, that has accuracy score around 0.75 - 0.9.
